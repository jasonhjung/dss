###### EXAMPLE: Leslie Knope (DELETE ME BEFORE SUBMITTING)
* I am currently the Deputy Director of the Parks and Recreation Department of Pawnee, Indiana. In this position, I successfully turned a dangerous pit into a beautiful community park called the Pawnee Commons. I absolutely love my job! I believe that the three most important things in life are friends, waffles, and work... or I mean, waffles, friends, and work. I am just an example of what you need to do, so please delete me before turning your project in.
* Jobs interested in: City Councilwoman, Midwest Regional Director of the National Parks Service, Governor of Indiana

###### Jason Jung

I'm majoring in Data Science and really enjoy it. I play intramural soccer with my friends and also enjoy traveling! I'm interested in artificial intelligence and would like to be able to do something related to that field one day!
* Jobs interested in: Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Artificial Intelligence Researcher

###### Harry Potter
* I am a recent Hogwarts dropout. I am looking for a position in something related to Defense Against the Dark Arts. I am also experienced with Transfiguration, Potions, and Charms. After dropping out, I embarked on a quest to find Hallows and Horcruxes, and managed to find each and every single one in the space of nine months, a feat which no other wizard or witch was able to do. Some things that make me unique are my abillity to speak to snakes and my Invisibility cloak.
* Jobs interested in: Auror, Hogwarts Professor, Quidditch Player

###### Jimin Ahn
* I am an exchange student from Yonsei University, South Korea! I study Economics back home and was fascinated to find how data science and statistical analysis are actively used in Economics class here at UC Berkeley. For the first two weeks of Cal, Data Science and coding was intimidating, and I felt like those were things that I can never achieve in life. However, I enrolled in Data 8 and am learning the fundamentals step by step. The more I learned, the more I became attracted to it. So, I challenged myself to take DSS DeCal to be exposed to the world of DS!
* Jobs interested in: UX Designer, Data Analyst, International Relations

###### Payton McSweeney
* I am a second year UC Berkeley student studying Data Science with a minor in Computer Science! I am interested in Data Analysis as well as software development. I'm a decent coder with experience in many projects from 61A and 61B, as well as working on my friend's start up company. Which helps visualize data for a number of companies. I am a member of Alpha Chi Omega, a social sorority on campus, for which I have been internal secretary and culture chair. I also participate in a dance organization on campus called AFX. Coding is my passion.
* Jobs interested in: Data Analyst, Software Engineer, President of DSS (jk)
